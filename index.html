   Tech Layoffs and Staffing Dynamics
  </h2>
  <ul class="category-key-points">
   <li>
    Silicon Valley experienced a major hiring increase during the pandemic, driven by soaring demand for tech services.
   </li>
   <li>
    Many tech companies are adjusting their staffing levels to reflect post-pandemic normalization of tech usage.
   </li>
   <li>
    Engineers are costly to hire, possess valuable knowledge, and often leave for better opportunities within a couple of years.
   </li>
   <li>
    Layoffs appear to be a correction from aggressive hiring strategies during the peak of the pandemic.
   </li>
   <li>
    Large tech firms may still have more employees post-layoffs than they did prior to the pandemic, reflecting the sector's growth.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="category-paragraph">
   The comments focus on the staffing dynamics in Silicon Valley, particularly the tech layoffs seen as a correction after the aggressive hiring during the pandemic. The pandemic led tech companies to rapidly increase their workforce to meet rising tech demands. However, as tech usage normalizes, these firms are recalibrating by conducting layoffs. Despite this, many large tech companies still employ more people than pre-pandemic levels. Engineers, despite being valuable and expensive to hire, frequently change companies, influenced by better job offers.
